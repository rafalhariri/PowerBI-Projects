# PowerBI-Projects

**# E-Commerce Analysis** 

In this project, I analyzed a real-world eCommerce dataset for Whiskique, an online pet supply company. The goal was to provide actionable insights into sales performance, customer locations, and operational efficiency using Power BI.

### Project Objectives:
1. **Sales Performance Analysis:**
   - **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Leveraged Power Query to clean and prepare the data, including handling empty invoice numbers, resolving inconsistent state entries, and linking state mapping with customer tables.
   - **Customer Insights:** Created new measures to count unique customers and calculate Customer Lifetime Value (CLV). Analyzed product sales and associated shipping costs.
   - **Product Analysis:** Identified top-selling products and those with higher shipping costs. Replaced inconsistent product descriptions using Power Query to ensure accurate analysis.
   - **Market Basket Analysis:** Conducted a market basket analysis to understand customer purchasing patterns and identify products frequently bought together.

2. **Shipping Cost Reduction:**
   - **What-If Analysis:** Developed a dynamic what-if analysis tool to explore different shipping cost scenarios. Calculated a "Blended Shipping Cost Factor" to allow for varying shipping costs based on quantity.
   - **Running Total Metrics:** Created measures for "Baseline Running Total," "What-If Running Total," and "Difference Running Total" to visualize the impact of shipping cost changes over time.

3. **Profitability Analysis:**
   - **COGS Calculation:** Introduced a "Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)" column to calculate costs based on landed cost and quantity.
   - **Profitability Metrics:** Developed a "Profit (Baseline)" measure to evaluate profitability after accounting for COGS and baseline shipping costs. Additionally, created a "Profit %" measure to assess profit margins relative to sales.

### Key Achievements:
- Successfully cleaned and prepared the data for analysis, ensuring accurate and reliable insights.
- Provided strategic recommendations for upselling, cross-selling, and shipping cost reduction.
- Developed interactive dashboards and visualizations that offer a comprehensive view of Whiskiqueâ€™s business performance.

This project highlights my ability to leverage Power BI for data-driven decision-making, from data cleaning and transformation to advanced DAX calculations and interactive visualizations.
